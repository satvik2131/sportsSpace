# sportsSpace
## Description

I designed and developed a sports space management system using Java for native Android. This platform enables users, such as students, to book a specific space for playing any sport. The application features an intuitive interface that allows users to easily view and book available spaces.
The system also includes an admin panel, which enables admins to view user requests and either approve or decline them, ensuring the fair and efficient allocation of sports spaces.
